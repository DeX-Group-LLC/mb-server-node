# Rules for Adding/Modifying Unit Tests

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure new unit tests thoroughly cover the functionality of any new code added.

2. **Test Execution:** Run `npm run test` after adding/modifying unit tests to confirm that all unit tests, including new and modified ones, pass successfully.

3. **JSDocs for Tests:** All unit tests must have JSDoc comments explaining the purpose of the test suite and each test case.

4. **Inline Comments for Tests:** Use inline comments within test cases to clarify assertions and any complex test logic.
