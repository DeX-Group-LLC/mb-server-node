# Rules for Modifying Source Code in `src`

- **ALWAYS:** Mention in your response "**Ruleset Applied:** src-rules.mdc" to indicate that this ruleset is in use.

## Coding Style

-   **Indentation:** 4 spaces.
-   **Line Length:** Keep lines under 100 characters.
-   **Braces:** Use braces `{}` for all control flow statements.
    -   Except for single line if statements.
-   **No Unused Variables:** Remove unused variables, imports, or parameters.

## Import Style

-   **Absolute Imports:** Use absolute imports based on `paths` in `tsconfig.json` (e.g., `import { ... } from '@core/...';`).
-   **No Relative Imports:** Do not use relative imports (e.g., `../`, `./`).
-   **Grouping (Order):**
    1. Standard Library
    2. External Modules
    3. Internal Modules
    4. Relative Imports (Avoid these, use absolute imports instead)
-   **Alphabetical Ordering:** Within each group, order imports alphabetically.

## Comments

-   **JSDoc:** Use JSDoc for functions, classes, methods, and interfaces. Include `@param`, `@returns`, and `@throws` tags.
-   **Inline Comments:** Explain complex or non-obvious code.
-   **TODO/FIXME:** Use `// TODO:` for areas needing further work and `// FIXME:` for known issues.

## Testing

-   **Mandatory Tests:** Write unit tests for all new or modified functions and classes.
-   **High Coverage:** Strive for 100% test coverage, including branches, unless otherwise specified.
-   **Test Rules:** Follow guidelines in [test-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/test-rules.mdc).

## Documentation

-   **Update Documentation:** Reflect code changes in relevant documentation.
-   **README:** Maintain a `README.md` in `src` explaining the codebase's purpose and structure.
-   **Doc Rules:** Follow guidelines in [doc-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/doc-rules.mdc).
